# Numbers-Numbers-and-Letter-game-
The Number game is Tv game that I used to watch when I was young and which I really liked.
The rules are simple you pick 6 random number from the following list:
      [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10,10,25,50,75,100]
And then there is a randomly selected number between 100 and 999

After that you can use arithmetic operations (additions + , substraction -, multiplication * ,division /) to reach the target number.
You can make up to 5 operations. 
The goal is to find the target or to be as close as possible.
